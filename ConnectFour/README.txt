Overview
---------------
Project took research on setting up a grid including images, animation for chip to show, how to play sound, and checking for wins.

On Sound:
------------
I implemented an audio file that would play a victory fanfare once the winner is declared. 
For some reason, the VM would only download it as an MP4? but I tried to use the audio from it anyways using the Mediaplayer built in android studio.
VM sound doesn't work for me so I can't actually tell if the sound plays, but it never gave me an error when I implemented the sound to play once the
"winner" text is shown. But its there!

On diagonal & winning check:
---------------
I had THE most trouble getting this to work. It only works if you win diagonally if you start bottom to up.
I couldn't get the diagonal from up to bottom to work for some reason. If I put in more time and research into it,
I probably would have gotten it since it must be a simple mistake I'm overlooking since I'm basing it off my previous diagonal check.

Drawing out the grid myself did help me with some debugging overall.

Reset button:
-----------------
I scratched my original concept of having a pause button since I think there wasn't really a need for one.
I did have a reset button, but mostly for easily testing the board. It is useful if the user would want to
play again too.
